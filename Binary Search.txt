## Searching 
1) Binary Search :
          Finding an element in the array/list.
          Binary search is a searching technique that is based upon the Divide-and-Conquer Rule.
   Working process:
          1.For Binary Search to be performed on any array, the array must be already sorted in 
            any format, that is, either ascending or descending.
          2.Find the middle index of the array/list.
          3.If the middle element is equal to the search element, Stop Searching and then 
            return 'element is found' at so and so index.
          4.If the element that is to be searched is less then the middle element then consider
            the first half as a separate list.
          5.Else-If the element that is to be searched is larger then the middle element then 
            consider the second half as a separate list.
          6.Repeat Step 2-3-4-5 Until desired result is found.

*Time complexity             *Space complexity
a)Best case --> O(1)          O(1)
b)Worst case --> O(log n)
c)Average case --> O(log n)
